# Landlordy

A web app that connects Landlord with confirmed tenants. Landlords are able to create an account, create properties, and send tenant invites.
Once an tenant accepts the invite from the landlord, the tenant is now associated with the landlord's property. The tenant can send rent payments and maintenance requests.

# Next Steps


-No Pictures; add some neat pictures.
-Perhaps connect to a Real Estate API to populate property images, info (# of beds, bathrooms, sqft, etc)
-Make nav bars for landlord/tenant
-Hide registration/login form if logged in
-Maintence form doesn't quite work well. Add ability to edit work order on Tenant Page. In Landlord Page, ability to check off a work order as in progress or completed.
-Payments: link up Bank accounts for both Landlord and Tenants.
